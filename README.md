# hotel-management-12th-grade-project
a simple program with python using csv for school project.

Our hotel management project, based on the platform developed by Guido van Rossum known as Python, covers the basic necessary functions required in a hotel such as booking a room, ordering food, checking out and displaying the bill.
The data is stored in the form of comma separated values (commonly known as CSV).
It is a menu driven program which makes use of various in-built modules such as OS etc.
We have developed this program with the highest efficiency we could obtain.
The program consists of both pre-defined and user-defined functions which has helped us to split the program into several blocks of code which has helped us to increase the efficiency which in turn has reduced the response time significantly.
It has also made the debugging process less cumbersome.
Any further development of the code can proceed trouble-free.
